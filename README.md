## 🚀 ProDev Backend Engineering Program Overview

This repository serves as a knowledge hub and documentation of my major learnings from the ProDev Backend Engineering program. It outlines the key technologies, core concepts, challenges, and best practices I have acquired in modern backend development.

The objective of this project is to consolidate my understanding and serve as a reference guide for future projects and collaboration.

## 💡 Major Learnings

### 1. Key Technologies Covered

* **Python:** *[Write about your key takeaways in Python, perhaps related to data structures, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), or its use in building robust applications.]*
* **Django & Django REST Framework (DRF):** *[Write about your experience building APIs, handling Models, Serializers, Views (FBVs/CBVs), and Authentication.]*
* **REST APIs:** *[Explain your understanding of REST principles, designing endpoints, and using different HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).]*
* **GraphQL:** *[Write about your experience with GraphQL, how it differs from REST, and how to build Schemas, Queries, and Mutations.]*
* **Docker:** *[Write about your understanding of containerization, how to write a Dockerfile, and using Docker Compose to link services (like Django, Postgres, Redis).]*
* **CI/CD:** *[Explain your understanding of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines, perhaps using tools like GitHub Actions.]*

### 2. Important Backend Concepts

* **Database Design:** *[Write about your understanding of database design, relationship types (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many), and normalization principles.]*
* **Asynchronous Programming:** *[Explain your understanding of asynchronous programming and why it's important. Mention your experience with Celery and RabbitMQ/Redis for managing background tasks.]*
* **Caching Strategies:** *[Write about the importance of caching for performance optimization and how you used tools like Redis for temporary data storage.]*

## 🔧 Challenges & Solutions

Here are some of the challenges I faced and how I solved them:

* **Challenge 1: [e.g., "Implementing JWT Authentication in DRF"]**
    * **Solution:** *[Explain the steps you took to solve it, e.g., "Used the Simple-JWT library, configured settings, and protected specific endpoints..."]*

* **Challenge 2: [e.g., "Running asynchronous tasks with Celery"]**
    * **Solution:** *[Explain the steps you took, e.g., "Configured Celery with RabbitMQ as a broker, defined tasks, and called them asynchronously..."]*

* **Challenge 3: [e.g., "Containerizing the multi-service application"]**
    * **Solution:** *[Explain the steps you took, e.g., "Wrote a Docker Compose file to link the Django app, Postgres DB, and Redis services, managing networks and volumes..."]*

## ✨ Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

* *[A key practice you learned, e.g., "Always use .env files to manage secret keys and configuration."]
* *[A key practice you learned, e.g., "Writing unit tests is not optional; it saves significant time in the long run."]
* *[A key practice you learned, e.g., "The importance of clear API documentation (like using Swagger/OpenAPI) for seamless frontend collaboration."]

## 🤝 Collaboration

This repository is part of a collaborative effort. I am open to exchanging ideas with fellow Backend learners and collaborating with Frontend learners from the `#ProDevProjectNexus` Discord channel to integrate and build full-stack applications.
